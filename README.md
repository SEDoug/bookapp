# Bookapp - personal book invnetory application

Created by @DougMacGregor || http://doug-macgregor.webflow.io/

Hello, this is a personal book inventory application that can be use for any personal library. 

I am using two android app's called Book Catalogue and Barcode Scanner to scan all of my personal books. This database can then be exported and emailed in a CSV format to be later used in a web application. More about the web application here: https://github.com/SEDoug/portfolioapp

This bookapp uses python and the flask microframework for the front end.  I also am using phpmyadmin, php and mySQL.
