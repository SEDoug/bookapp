### Personal book inventory application

Created by @DougMacGregor || http://doug-macgregor.webflow.io/<br>
Seeking a broader field and desire to do work in full stack development.

Hello, this is a personal book inventory application that can be use for any personal library. 

I am using two android app's called Book Catalogue and Barcode Scanner to scan all of my personal books. This database can then be exported and emailed in a CSV format to be later used in a web application. More about the web application here: https://github.com/SEDoug/portfolioapp

This bookapp uses python and the flask microframework for the front end.  I also am using phpmyadmin, php and mySQL.

**more updates to come**

# portfolioapp
This is a simple web application written in python with flask-microframework together with bootstrap. I have used code from other programmers to learn how all the pieces work.  I will be tweaking the application to fit my needs and explain what I have learned along the way.

I have also mixed in a personal book inventory application that is also written in python with the help of php and mysql.  More about this project can be found here:  https://github.com/SEDoug/bookapp
