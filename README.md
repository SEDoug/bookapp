# bookapp
Hello, this is a home book inventory application that can be use for any personal book library. 

I am using an android app called Book Catalogue and Barcode Scanner to scan all of my books that will then be exported and emailed in a CSV format.

This bookapp uses flask for the front end.  I also am using phpmyadmin, php and mySQL.
