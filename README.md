# portfolioapp
This is a simple web application written in python with flask-microframework together with bootstrap. I have used code from other programmers to learn how all the pieces work.  I will be tweaking the application to fit my needs and explain what I have learned along the way.

I have also mixed in a personal book inventory application that is also written in python with the help of php and mysql.  More about this project can be found here:  https://github.com/SEDoug/bookapp
