# bookapp
Hello, this is a home book inventory application that can be use for any personal book library. 

I am using two android app's called Book Catalogue and Barcode Scanner to scan all of my personal books. This database can then be exported and emailed in a CSV format to be later used in a web application.

This bookapp uses python and the flask microframework for the front end.  I also am using phpmyadmin, php and mySQL.

**more updates to come**
